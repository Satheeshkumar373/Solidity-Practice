# Day 1 -HelloEther

This is a simple smart contract to set initail message and update it.

## Why I made this

I created this project to learn about solidity and practicing smart contracts.

## How it works

- It sets the initial message.
- Allows to modify the message with whatever I want.
- Emits an event(MessageUpdated) with old and new message whenever the message is updated.
- Events are not directly displayed in the remix.
- It is listened by frontend applications.

## Tools used:

- Solidity
- Remix IDE
- Github for vcs
